 *
 * A value that is not text-shaped (array, bool, non-Stringable object) is
 * client input in the wrong shape — e.g. `field[]=x` arrives as an array — so
 * it fails validation with the rule's normal message rather than being cast
 * (which warns on arrays, coerces to the literal "Array", and fatals on
